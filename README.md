## Challenge Part 2: Analysis of "Delete User" Functionality

### Overview

In this section, we will analyze whether the requirement "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication" is a good idea. We will also clarify the difference between authentication and authorization, two fundamental concepts in security.

### Analysis

#### Is Allowing "Delete User" Functionality After Authentication a Good Idea?

**Authentication** and **authorization** are crucial concepts in securing applications. Authentication verifies who a user is, while authorization determines what a user can do.

1. **Authentication** ensures that a user is who they claim to be. Typically, this involves verifying credentials such as a username and password. 

2. **Authorization** determines what actions a user is permitted to perform once authenticated. This includes access control to various features and data within the application.

Given these definitions, allowing the "delete user" functionality only after authentication is a fundamental requirement. However, this alone may not be sufficient for secure implementation. Here’s why:

- **Authentication Alone Is Not Enough**: Once authenticated, a user might have access to various functionalities based on their role or permissions. If the delete functionality is only accessible after authentication, it does not guarantee that only authorized users can perform the action. 

- **Authorization Checks Are Crucial**: To ensure that only users with the right privileges can delete an account, you must implement additional authorization checks. For example, a regular user should not be able to delete other users’ accounts, including their own, without proper permissions.

#### Example of How to Implement Secure Deletion

1. **Authentication**: Verify the user’s identity by checking their credentials.

2. **Authorization**: Check if the authenticated user has the permission to delete an account. This involves checking user roles or permissions and ensuring that the deletion request is valid (e.g., the user is an admin or has specific rights).

3. **Additional Safeguards**: Implement additional safeguards like confirmation prompts or multi-factor authentication for critical actions such as account deletion.

### Authentication vs. Authorization

#### Authentication

- **Definition**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. This typically involves checking credentials such as usernames and passwords.
- **Example**: Logging into a system with your username and password.

#### Authorization

- **Definition**: The process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It involves setting permissions and roles.
- **Example**: An admin user being able to access the admin dashboard while a regular user cannot.

### Conclusion

While allowing "delete user" functionality after authentication is a necessary step, it is not sufficient on its own. Proper authorization controls are essential to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can perform sensitive actions like deleting user accounts. Understanding the distinction between authentication and authorization helps in implementing robust security measures that protect user data and system integrity.
